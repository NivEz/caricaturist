## Caricaturist

#### A bot that scrapes every day Calcalist's news and checks if a new caricature was uploaded (not being uploaded daily). If so, it sends the caricature in a public Telegram channel.

I used:
* Firebase functions for the cron job and the server.
* Cheerio for the scraping.
* Telegram API.
